When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share it with others or collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there could be changes on the remote repository that could conflict with your local version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones are copies of repositories in git. Cloning is used for copying a repository. Forks are clones on GitHub. Forks are used for copying a repository on GitHub and giving credit to the original author. Branches are part of one repository. Branches are used for adding code while maintaining a master working version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locall?
You will have the newest changes and all of the history of the repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
To collaborate we would have to use DropBox or Google Drive or some other form of file sharing. I'm not sure what would be easier, but it would be harder to know what is different or how to merge the files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When working on a project and you don't want to break the master branch. Working directly on the master could break the whole program for everyone working on it.
