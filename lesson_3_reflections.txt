When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share it with others or collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there could be changes on the remote repository that could conflict with your local version.
