What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a repository and the files needed in the directory which will allow us to make commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is only what will be committed, while the working directory has everything. This allows you to make incremental logical commits.
